    "text": "Speed ​​came to China. He didn't know that there were so many people who knew him and liked him living in this magical land. The fans here showed him unimaginable enthusiasm. What shocked him and his team was that the fans here respected him very much. They were excited but very restrained when they saw him. They knew that he was tired and would give him water. They knew that he was hungry and would feed him. This was the case in every city he passed through! Because this is the Chinese etiquette of hospitality. Friends coming from afar must be fed and well-nourished!\r\n\r\nHe met Tian Yiming and sang his favorite song \"Love You at 105 Degrees\" together;\r\n\r\nHe climbed the Great Wall and saw the super weapon of Chinese aunties: \"Level 10 Beauty\";\r\n\r\nHe went to Shaolin Temple, made friends through martial arts and met Master Liang, who may be the best martial arts teacher in his life;\r\n\r\nHe ate an authentic Chengdu hot pot and tasted what authentic spicy and hot is;\r\n\r\nHe saw why Chongqing is called the cyberpunk city, and also showed the world the real shock of China beyond the foreign media filter;\r\n\r\nHe had a beautiful encounter on a cruise ship in Hong Kong that saved the entire live broadcast. A sweet girl from Zhejiang showed him the cuteness, friendliness, innocence and romance of Chinese girls;\r\n\r\nHe experienced the high-tech from China in Shenzhen that stunned the world;\r\n\r\nHe finally came to Changsha and finally met Da Zhangwei, and sang Sunshine Rainbow Little White Horse together. It was also because of Da Zhangwei's popular song that he won countless fans in China;\r\n\r\nHe also met a friendly and enthusiastic Chinese uncle who treated him as a brother. He followed him all the way in various cities in China and took care of him willingly. This is the best interpretation of fate and friendship from Chinese men!\r\n\r\nThank you Speed, thank you for showing the world the true side of this country and the people on this land!\r\n\r\nThere is an old Chinese saying: \"It is a great pleasure to have friends coming from afar! All people in the world are brothers!\"\r\nI guess Speed ​​has realized the meaning of this sentence during his trip to China!",

    "text": "Dear IShowSpeed,\n\nI'm writing to express my sincere gratitude for your recent China trip and the live streams you shared with the world. As a Chinese, I was deeply touched by your genuine exploration of my country.\n\nFor a long time, Western media have spread so much misinformation about China that many people around the world have formed inaccurate impressions of us. But you, with your unfiltered live broadcasts, have shattered those false images. You showed the world China's modern cities, high - speed trains with stable network connections even in tunnels, the rich and vibrant street life, and most importantly, the warmth and friendliness of the Chinese people.\n\nWhen you sang “Sunshine Rainbow Little White Horse” with Chinese fans on the street, and when you were amazed by the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, and the Sichuan Opera, those real - time reactions were like a window, allowing the world to see the real China. Your journey across Shanghai, Beijing, Henan, and Chengdu has presented a vivid and three - dimensional view of my homeland.\n\nThank you for being a bridge between different cultures. Your visit has not only let the world know China better but also brought closer the hearts of people from different countries. I hope you will come back to China again soon and continue to discover more of its beauty and charm.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",

That's why when Joson says \"你好吗?\" to others, few respond because it sounds strange and people find it hard to react; as for why that guy suggested using \"你好吗?\" as a greeting, I think he might have been nervous and misspoke.",

Similarly, he wants to appear on Speed's live broadcasts all the time just to promote his hometown's products, so that Chinese consumers can know about their hometown's specialties. Moreover, he often appears in various public welfare activities, such as helping the elderly in nursing homes and earthquake relief. He is a volunteer and has many government issued public welfare honor certificates! Many people think he is an Internet clown, but I don't think so. I admire him very much! If he frequently enters the live broadcast and disturbs everyone, I am willing to apologize for him. He is really a good person",

We are the torchbearers for doing anything in the world.\n\nWesterners today: WOW China is the best! We love China! I would love to visit and live in China!\n\nMoral of the story: Never trust the love and respect shown by Westerners, cuz they run after money. Once you lose your wealth, all that affection and respect towards you will be lost. East (whole of South, Southeast, and East Asia)has always been like the old money cultures which were prosperous for a long time, mainly cuz of their social norms and values. West lacks in those aspects, and it is a ticking time bomb, which will affect its global power someday. Its downfall has already begun. Even if we look back in history, they showed love towards the rich regions and later plundered them and mocked them for their poverty...which is continuing to this day. There is no way that they could do that again, but the only thing they could do rn is show fake love.",

I am familiar with Chengdu, so I found that after he went to Chengdu, he was exposed to ear cleaning, massage, hot pot, and pandas. Yes, these are quite common in Chengdu, but I don't understand why there are so many fans in China who come to see him. For our generation, this foreign blogger, we don't know him at all, and we won't watch any of his videos. I think it's probably because the news of his coming to China was reported by most media. In fact, Chengdu people are quite arrogant, they won't easily surround foreigners. If you don't believe it, live in Chengdu for a month, and you will find that gradually no one will pay attention to you... Everyone lives their own life and only regards you as an ordinary person. This is the essence of life. Finally, welcome to Chengdu.",
